                    Choosing Education as my course may be one of the best decisions I ever made. Although I cried at first because never in my life have I imagined to be a teacher. 
                But as time goes by, I realized that being a teacher may not be bad after all, we get to see the sides of ourselves we never knew existed. 
                I  Iearned to become creative, innovative, and most importantly, I have learned to study harder. 
                Being a teacher is an exhilarating feeling for me. Not only did I discover my full potential, but my students' as well. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                    Teaching is  the art of imparting knowledge and shaping minds, is a noble calling that transcends boundaries and enriches lives. 
                It is a transformative art that requires dedication, passion, and a profound understanding of human nature. 
                Teachers are the catalysts who ignite the spark of curiosity, guide the path towards discovery, and foster a lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                    Teaching is a responsibility that we must be fully aware. We are the role models of the future generations. 
                As a teacher, we must provide a safe space for students to express themselves freely and are not afraid to speak what's in their minds. 
                We have to create a safe haven for our students ho feel more safe and create a harmonious relationship to one another. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                    As an aspiring teacher, I will do my best do impart knwoledge and values to my students. 
                I will lead them achieving a better versions of themselves. It is my job to teach them the importance of education in life. 
                Seeing my students' success is a great reward nothing can compare.
